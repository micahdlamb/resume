		<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Web Developer and DevOps Engineer at DHL<div>Feb 2018 - Nov 2020</div></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Developed a React & Java based document management system (eDOC). It's part of the DHL Go Green Initiative intending to eliminate all paper usage by 2030. Documents arrive into eDOC through automated warehouse processes, manual upload and the eDOC API. Advanced search functionality allows documents to be found and downloaded through the browser and API. Signing can be done in a multitude of ways using any touchscreen device. Custom forms/waivers are setup and completed by warehouse employees.
					</li>
					<li>
						Converted several existing Java/Python/JavaScript webapps and background processes to be run on a devops infrastructure with continuous integration.  This involved containerizing (Docker) the apps and building a Jenkins pipeline to test and deploy them to an Openshift/Kubernetes cluster.
					</li>
					<li>
						Analyzed years of shipping data to build a machine learning model able forecast seasonal shipping rates and delivery durations with reasonable accuracy.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pioneered a project to automate warehouse configuration testing. Processes (like a truck being received at a warehouse and unloaded) were simulated by python scripts. Selenium was used to navigate the warehouse management website and telnet messages controlled the RF scanner devices. This proof of concept was continued by others and eventually replaced a team of QA testers.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Software Developer at Altair Engineering<div>Oct 2013 - Feb 2018, Nov 2020 - Present</div></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Collaborated with engineers to develop a multibody dynamics plugin for Inspire that has become an integral part of the platform. It was coded in Python on top of the existing C++ Inspire code. It allows mechanisms to be constructed and their motion analyzed. Simulation results are visualized as animations and plots. The computed forces are used in other Inspire analyses like shape optimization which finds optimally strong shapes for manufactured parts.
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Worked on the base python library used to implement Inspire Motion and other Inspire plugins. Customers also have access to the API to build their own company specific features and customizations.
						</p>
						<p>
							The core capability of the library is the ability to define new modelling entities plus all the UI to visualize and edit them in the graphics window and other views. Entities are able to participate in simulations by implementing the solver interfaces.
						</p>
						<p>
							Great effort was made to keep the code well documented and easy to use. C++ code was wrapped to be more "Pythonic". Over time new features could be implemented faster with drastically fewer lines of code than C++ implementations. Success was achieved through regular code reviews with experienced developers.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Created unit/integration tests for all features and bug fixes using pytest. Jenkins compiled a new build after every code commit and ensured the tests passed.
					</li>
				</ul>
