		<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Software Developer at Altair Engineering<div>Oct 2013 - Feb 2018</div></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Collaborated with engineers to develop a multibody dynamics plugin for <a href='https://altair.com/inspire'>Inspire</a> that has become an integral part of the platform.
						It allows manufacturers to design and analyze the motion of mechanisms.
						Simulation results are visualized as animations and plots.
						The computed forces are fed into subsequent structural analyses, such as shape optimization.
					</li>
					<li>
						Developed the foundational Python library underpinning Inspire Motion and a suite of other manufacturing plugins for Casting, 3D Printing, <a href="https://altair.com/product-showcase#search=inspire">...</a>
						It enables extending the C++ data model with new entities in Python plus all the UI to visualize and edit them in the graphics window and other views.
						Wrapped core APIs to be more pythonic and much simpler to use.
						Added sphinx documentation and demos to support customer usage to build company specific customizations.
					</li>
					<li>
						Created/maintained the test suite for all of Inspire using pytest. Leveraged Jenkins for compiling and executing tests post-commit.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Team Lead at Altair Engineering<div>Nov 2020 - Present</div></h3>

					</li>
					<li>
						Transitioned a diverse suite of web applications and background processes from VM hosting to a new containerized infrastructure (Openshift) with continuous integration.
					</li>
					<li>
						Analyzed shipping data to create a machine learning model capable of forecasting seasonal shipping rates and delivery times with reasonable accuracy.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pioneered a project to automate warehouse software + configuration testing through Python scripts. Utilized Selenium to navigate the warehouse management website and telnet to simulate scanning RF devices. This proof of concept was expanded upon by others, eventually replacing a team of QA testers.
